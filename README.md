A Sentiment analyser and response system that lets business owners and managers analyse
the customer’s google reviews. The core of the project is based on Web Scraping through
Beautiful soup and Selenium and building Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language
processing. This would let business owners and managers acquire a lucid picture of the
customer’s sentiment about their brand and also help them figure out the root cause of the
issues discussed by the customer’s in the reviews. An NLP model is used to predict the
sentiment of the review, and response system is placed based on the sentiment of the review,
this will help the organisation work on the customers' most discussed issues and resolve and
increase their productivity.
